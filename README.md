This assignment is mostly about file management and learning how files relate to one another.

Starting with the poorly constructed index.html file, fix the errors (3 naming, 4 indentation/formatting), create the rest of the HTML files, then link them all, adding images and links as indicated.

The overall structure of the site will include two “index.html” files throughout the site. This is how website links like “www.domainname.com/about” work.

You must add some CSS just for practice. So please modify at least the basics: background colour, font, and type colour.

Pay attention to the “href” attribute when using files in a sub-directory (The Portfolio files can’t “find” css/styles.css without recursing to the root directory in the css link)

Try: <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/styles.css">

After you finish your first file, you can “Save As” to keep your basic structure and content consistent from page to page. (A “Template”!)

Code the entire thing by hand. As per normal, do not use any pre-coded templates.

LINKING AND ADDING CONTENT

Fix directory/file names to proper naming conventions
index.html – Insert the logo, link the logo to index.html
Create 3 text links to to about.html, contact.html and portfolio/index.html
Now "Save As..." to create your next pages

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH PAGE:

about.html – Two (2) paragraphs of text, plus a link to Twitter.com (your account or main home page)
contact.html – ‘mailto’ link to your school email
portfolio/index.html – Three image thumbnails (small images) that link to the three works pages (below):
- portfolio/work-1.html – Display work-1.jpg at full size and link back to portfolio/index.html
- portfolio/work-2.html – Display work-2.jpg at full size and link back to portfolio/index.html
